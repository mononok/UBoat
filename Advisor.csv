Tutorial Open Controller,
Tutorial Prepare Boat,"It's a perfect time for you to get familiar with the boat and prepare for what is to come.
<line-height=50%>
<line-height=100%>I've prepared a list of things worth doing in the meantime. Select officer Kohler and assign him necessary tasks or if you prefer to play in FPP click on him twice."
Tutorial Galley 1,"Remember, that if the galley runs out of food, cook will take random food from the storage to prepare the meals.

Sometimes you may want to serve the crew a few food types. That will boost the discipline recovery at a cost of faster consumption. I suggest you to do exactly that for better integration of our crew."
Tutorial Galley 2,"You can manually transfer food through the backpack of your character, but there is a faster way.

Click ""Galley"" tab on the right."
Tutorial Galley 3,Now drag the exotic fruits from the storage directly to the galley and accept your decision..
Tutorial Time Compression,Let's speed things up. Turn on time compression by pressing the highlighted button in the interface or click the middle mouse button.
Tutorial Time Compression Controller,Let's speed things up. Turn on time compression by pressing the left trigger.
Tutorial Skip Travel,"When you are in a friendly or neutral area, then also the Fast Travel mode becomes available. It is displayed next to the regular time compression button. Click it to rapidly move out of the current area."
Tutorial Skip Travel Controller,When you are in a friendly or neutral area there is even a better time compression available that shows up among notifications on the right. Click it to rapidly move out of the current area.
Tutorial Reflector,"Considering that it's pretty dark, I suggest you turn on the searchlight mounted on the conning tower. I don't think that we will be able to spot the wreck otherwise."
Tutorial Targeting Sight,Send officer Kohler to the targeting sight on the conning tower to look for the wreck in the area.
Tutorial Diver,"In this game, you won't be controlling just a single character, but all the officers. Officer Sommer is in front of you, he is an officer like Kohler and will be a playable character from now on. Considering that we found the wreck, equip him a diving suit and send to the wreck to explore."
Tutorial Storage,Hmm�c there is nothing worth our time in this box. Let's check two more.
Tutorial Storage Controller, Hmm�c there is nothing worth our time in this box. Let's check two more.

Tutorial Pause,"The hull has been breached! Fast, press the space button on the keyboard!"
Tutorial Pause Controller," The hull has been breached! Quickly, press <sprite name=""JoystickButton1"">!"
Tutorial Lock Compartment,"In such a situation always stop the game and carefully plan what to do as each second matters.

At this time, there are two leaks on board, one is serious, but the second is smaller and won't be that dangerous until we dive to a greater depth.

I don't see any way to save the aft compartment. Move camera to the aft part of the boat and click highlighted evacuation button."
Tutorial Repair,"While Kohler takes care of closing the compartment, send engineer Felix West for replacement parts to the storage room."
Tutorial Repair 2,Very good. West took the replacement parts and he can do repairs. Select him and order to repair the leak of the evacuation hatch in the galley.
Tutorial Unpause,Everything is ready. You can unpause the game now.
Tutorial Flashlight,"During some nights visibility outside is very low. Press ""F"", to turn on the flashlight."
Tutorial Flashlight Controller,"During some nights visibility outside is very low. Press ""F"", to turn on the flashlight."
Tutorial Pump,Now select and send Kohler to turn on the pump to pump out the water from the leak.
Tutorial Carry Water,"The pump can pump out water from all compartments on board, but because of the resistance of the pipes, it is most efficient to do this from the central compartment.

Although there is no need now, at deeper depths you may be forced to carry water with buckets to the central compartment to pump it outside."
Tutorial Dry Compartment,"We have used most of our compressed air reserves for the emergency blowing. We have to use the air compressor to regenerate them�c but it's located in the flooded compartment.

It's time to dry the stern compartment. Open the bulkhead leading to it and start repairs. Remember to repair the hole at the top of the hull first. After that, take the air compressor and turn it on."
Tutorial Rebreather,"One more thing! Before you open the bulkhead, I suggest you equip the engineer with an oxygen mask from the storage room. Without it, he won't be able to perform eventual repairs under the water�fs surface in the compartment."
Tutorial Aircraft Carrier,Hmm�c that aircraft flew too fast after our boat was detected by the destroyer. There has to be an aircraft carrier nearby!
Tutorial Hydrophone,"There is a hydrophone mounted on your boat. If the aircraft carrier is moving, we may be able to detect it.

Select Adam Neumann, our radio officer, and assign him to the listening room at the hydrophone."
Tutorial Hydrophone 2,"Remember that in order to detect anything with our current GHG hydrophone, you first need to submerge to at least some depth.

Send any free officer to the valves in the control room."
Tutorial Wreckage,"Look at that! In these crates may be the equipment that we are looking for. Let's try to check some of them.

One thing at a time though - stop the engines so that we won't pass the wreckage."
Tutorial Boxes,"We can now check the contents of the crates floating from the wreckage.

You can activate all objects floating on the sea's surface in the same way as the stations on your boat. It's easiest to look for them in the first person perspective."
Tutorial Escort Carrier Area,"We are in the area where we detected the aircraft carrier earlier. Visibility is very low�c send Kohler to the conning tower to the targeting sight so he can help look for the enemy.

Considering that u-boats on the surface are harder to spot than the average ship - night and bad weather work for us, and allow us to get close to the enemy without detection."
Tutorial Disable Reflector,"Although the searchlight increases our vision range, it reveals our location to the enemy. I suggest you send any officer to turn it off."
Tutorial Attack Carrier,"It worked! The radioman clearly heard the propeller of a larger vessel not far from here.

Turn on the map and click the right mouse button on the aircraft carrier group to set the course to it."
Tutorial Surface 2,Now send any officer to the valves to surface back again. Long distance travels under the water are definitely slower and less economical. The fast travel mode is also not available at that time.
Tutorial Load Torpedoes,We are going to need all the torpedoes to get such a prize. Select our engineer - West - and send him to load a torpedo in one of the free tubes.
Tutorial Escort Carrier Spotted,"We spotted the aircraft carrier! It has separated from its escort, probably because of the fog. It's a great moment to attack!

In similar situations, remember to keep your boat at right distance to stay undetected. Click highlighted button and choose first forward gear for the engines."
Tutorial Escort Carrier Spotted 2,"Good. Let's start the targeting process.

Select officer Kohler."
Tutorial Aim,"In the upper left part of the screen you will see a list of targets spotted by the officer.

Click with the right mouse button on the aircraft carrier to start the targeting process. That will make the officer focus on taking the bearings for the target instead of, for example, looking for new targets."
Tutorial Fire,"Kohler has a good bearing on our target. It's a good time to fire.

Select officer Kohler and then click with the left mouse button on the aircraft carrier on the list."
Tutorial Fire 2,Now click the highlighted button to open the torpedo interface.
Tutorial Fire 3,Very good! Now click on all tubes sequentially to flood them.
Tutorial Fire 4,All tubes are flooded and good to go. Fire!
Tutorial Dive 200 0,The ringing of the alarm bells of the escort is heard. It's only a matter of time before they detect us.
Tutorial Dive 200 1,Send one of the officers to the valves and flood the ballast tanks.
Tutorial Dive 200 2,Now press the highlighted button and set the target depth at 180 meters.
Tutorial Surface,"There is a leak on board and we don't have any replacement parts left to fix it. The only thing we can do is to evacuate the compartment and surface the boat. Let's hope we lost those chasing us...

Leaks marked with a yellow icon are extremely dangerous at greater depths, however, on the surface, a pump will easily pump out flowing water."
Tutorial Skip Travel 2,"The officer has managed to spot the wreck! Plot a direct course towards it.

To open map, press ""M"" key."
Tutorial Skip Travel 3,"Enable fast travel mode, to rapidly move to your destination."
Tutorial Wreck Out of Range,Our boat has moved far away from the wreck. Plot the course back before sending the diver.
Tutorial Disable Gyrocompass 1,"When escaping from an enemy underwater, remember that most hostile warships have hydrophones on board.

Because of that, it is good to turn off everything that emits sound on your ship. If you move the cursor to detection notification on the right part of the screen, you will see a list of such devices."
Tutorial Disable Gyrocompass 2,Order any officer to turn off the gyrocompass. Its use is rather limited while escaping under the water.
Tutorial Escort Carrier Spotted 2 Alt,"Good. Let's start the aiming process.

Send officer Kohler to the targeting sight."
Tutorial Wreck Area Reached,"We've reached the area where, according to our intelligence, the Falcon wreck should be located. Keep your eyes open, we have to find it before the British."
Tutorial Smoke on Horizon,We saw the mast of a warship on the horizon. It's definitely British ... we need to hurry.
Tutorial Followers,"We need to see the enemy first. To maximize our chances, I suggest that you give Kohler some help. Select him and press the illuminated button two times to recruit random crewmen to work with the officer. They will help him with observation and thereby increase our range of vision. """

Tutorial 02 - Periscope Depth 01,We are now at the target location. We can now practice how to dive
Tutorial 02 - Periscope Depth 02,"First, we will dive to periscope depth, which is just below the surface of the water. Click the highlighted button to open the depth meter and then click the small button on the right with a periscope icon."
Tutorial 02 - Periscope 01,"Well done, skipper. Your boat is now at periscope depth."
Tutorial 02 - Periscope 02,"Remaining at periscope depth means staying just below the water's surface, allowing the crew to extend periscopes above the water to scan the surroundings."
Tutorial 02 - Periscope 03,There are two periscopes installed on this submarine. The observation periscope is conveniently located in the control room. It's good for scanning quickly the surroundings and it's usually used by the regular crew.
Tutorial 02 - Periscope 04,"The attack periscope on the other hand is designed to perform precise torpedo attacks. It's much better at this task than the observation periscope, but it must be manned by an officer."
Tutorial 02 - Periscope 05,"Your submarine is extremely hard to spot when it stays at periscope depth, although it's still possible to spot it at close range.

It's also vulnerable here to detection methods that use the sound waves for detection - hydrophones and sonars."
Tutorial 02 - Deeper 01,"Now, let's dive deeper. Click the highlighted button again to open the depth meter and select the maximum safe depth button."
Tutorial 02 - Deeper 02,"We are now 150 meters below the surface... Pressure outside is around 16 atmospheres. This submarine was built to handle such pressure indefinitely, but going deeper than this comes with a risk."
Tutorial 02 - Deeper 03,"As a rule of thumb, the deeper you dive, the easier it is to hide from enemies. Your submarine also becomes harder to hit with anti-submarine weapons."
Tutorial 02 - Air 01,"Staying under water comes with some problems though.

When you remain under water, there is no way to vent the ship and air quality will become worse with the passing of time."
Tutorial 02 - Air 02,"You can always check the current air quality, by looking at this indicator. It's very important.

If it ever becomes empty, your crew will start to suffocate."
Tutorial 02 - Air 03,"You can refresh air to some degree by using the on-board ventilation system, but it has the drawback of being quite noisy. Enemies may detect your ship more easily, when it's turned on."
Tutorial 02 - Air 04,Let's use it right now. Click on it using the <b>left mouse button</b>.
Tutorial 02 - Air 05,"Well done. After you gave the order, one of the sailors will come here soon and activate the ventilation system."
Tutorial 02 - Air 06,Notice that the air quality in the ship starts to get better.  The ventilation system won't improve it indefinitely though as it can only recirculate existing air.
Tutorial 02 - Pump 01,"Another thing to watch, when you stay underwater for a long time, are the bilges of your ship.

Your submarine will slowly accumulate water through the holes in the ship's hull like the propeller shafts, periscopes, valves and the torpedo tubes."
Tutorial 02 - Pump 02,"When ballast accumulates, your ship will be less maneuverable and responsive.

Eventually that ballast may sink your ship, but we will learn about that in more detail during the next training assignments."
Tutorial 02 - Pump 03,"To get rid of the accumulated water, enable the pump in the control room. Please do that right now, before we proceed."
Tutorial 02 - Pump 04,Well done. The Pump slowly pumps out the water from all your compartments.
Tutorial 02 - Pump 05,"Please note, that the performance of the pump is correlated with the pressure of the water outside the ship. At 150 meters it basically doesn't do anything useful! We must move to a shallower depth to get rid of the water."
Tutorial 02 - Pump 06,Let's get back to the surface. Please click the depth meter button and then select the surface preset button.
Tutorial 02 - Surface 01,"Good to be back. To surface the ship, your crew had to blow the water out of the ballast tanks using the compressed air reserves. You can check how much compressed air you have by looking at this notification."
Tutorial 02 - Surface 02,Compressed air is stored in a special tanks under the hull. You can replenish it using air compressors installed on your ship.
Tutorial 02 - Surface 03,"You have two air compressors at your disposal. One is a medium-performance electric compressor and the second, larger one, is a high-performance diesel compressor in stern torpedo room.

You may use one or both of them, depending on the resources you have and the circumstances you find yourself in."
Tutorial 02 - Surface 04,"Please enable one, or both of them now."
Tutorial 02 - Surface 05,Well done skipper!
Tutorial 02 - Surface 06,"To surface your ship after diving, you need at minimum 25% of the compressed air reserves. The amount consumed is not constant though. The deeper you are and the larger the ballast you have in the compartments to compensate, the more air may be consumed in the process."
Tutorial 02 - Return to Port 01,Well done skipper! You learned a lot today. Let's get back to the port.
Tutorial 02 - Return to Port 02,Open the map and right click on the port icon to plot a course to it.
Tutorial 03 - Intro 01,"Hello skipper!

During this training assignment we will make an attempt to attack the enemy shipping. I will also teach you the basics of the crew management."
Tutorial 03 - Open Map 01,"Please open the map, before we continue."
Tutorial 03 - Set Course 01,"Another u-boat reported spotting a few freighters headed at square {0} a few hours ago.

The u-boat was coming back from a mine laying assignment and wasn't armed to attack the ships at the time."
Tutorial 03 - Set Course 02,"I marked a spot where we expect these freighters to be in the near future.

Please right click on the marked point to set a course there."
Tutorial 03 - Undock 01,"Everything is ready. Now we must undock from the port. To do that, click the highlighted button and select the third engine gear forward."
Tutorial 03 - Arrive 01,"Very good. You arrived at the area.

We should start searching for the cargo ships."
Tutorial 03 - Arrive 02,"Let's take a look inside the ship for a moment.

As you see, your crew is already active and work on various stations on the ship. They know their tasks very well and don't need directions to perform it for most of the time."
Tutorial 03 - Arrive 03,"During long assignments and battles unusual things tend to happen and your role, as a captain of this boat, is to adapt as necessary to survive."
Tutorial 03 - Arrive 04,"For this reason, I have asked your officers to leave their stations, so that we can train micro-management during this assignment."
Tutorial 03 - Arrive 05,"We must locate the cargo ships we are looking for.

The best way to accomplish that is to use the on-board hydrophone. It's capable of detecting ships from tens of kilometers. Much farther than it's possible by sight, even in the best weather."
Tutorial 03 - Submerge 01,"The GHG hydrophone installed on your ship doesn't work on the surface though.

We must submerge to periscope depth, before we can proceed."
Tutorial 03 - Hydrophone 01,"The hydrophone can be manned by any trained officer, but radiomen excel at this task. Select officer {0}, your radioman, before we proceed."
Tutorial 03 - Hydrophone 02,Now click on the listening room to assign him there.
Tutorial 03 - Hydrophone 03,"Good. Now let's give the officer some time to listen for contacts. You can use the time compression, if you like."
Tutorial 03 - Capture Course 01,Excellent! {0} hears the ship propellers nearby through the hydrophone.
Tutorial 03 - Capture Course 02,Click on the contact using a <b>right mouse button</b> to plot an interception course towards it.
Tutorial 03 - Periscope Assign 01,Shhh! The sailor using the periscope has spotted the freighter. We can attack it now.
Tutorial 03 - Periscope Assign 02,"The most effective weapon at your disposal are G7 torpedoes that carry a 280 kg warhead.

Aside from their sheer power, that may rip a ship apart, they usually do not reveal your position to the enemy. It's your primary weapon."
Tutorial 03 - Periscope Assign 03,"To use them, we first need to compute a course for the torpedo.

Please select officer {0}, before we continue."
Tutorial 03 - Periscope Assign 04,Good. Now send him over to the attack periscope in the conning tower.
Tutorial 03 - Out of Range 01,"The freighter is currently out of the visual range. We must wait until it comes back into visual range, before we proceed."
Tutorial 03 - Torpedo Course 01,Officer {0} arrived at the periscope. Select him before we proceed.
Tutorial 03 - Torpedo Course 02,"Having selected the officer, click on the enemy cargo ship using the <b>right mouse button</b> to calculate torpedo course."
Tutorial 03 - Torpedo Course 03,"Very good. Officer {0} now calculates the course for the torpedo.

We should give him some time to do that. I will give you further directions once that's done."
Tutorial 03 - Torpedo Launch 01,Officer {0} managed to prepare a decent torpedo course solution. It's time to launch the torpedoes at the target.
Tutorial 03 - Torpedo Launch 01 Second Attempt,"Sadly, the first salvo didn't hit the target. Our officer loaded a new set of torpedoes into the tubes. Let's try again."
Tutorial 03 - Torpedo Launch 02,Select enemy ship using <b>a left mouse button</b> before we proceed.
Tutorial 03 - Torpedo Launch 03,Good. Now click the highlighted button to open the torpedo tubes interface.
Tutorial 03 - Torpedo Launch 04,Click on at least three tubes to flood the tubes with sea water.
Tutorial 03 - Torpedo Launch 05,"Everything is set. Fire, captain!"
Tutorial 03 - Surface Ship 01,Well done captain. This freighter is finished.
Tutorial 03 - Surface Ship 02,The original report mentioned two freighters headed to this area. The second one may also be around.
Tutorial 03 - Surface Ship 03,Let's return to the surface and look around. Click the highlighted buttons.
Tutorial 03 - Observation 01,"Good to be back. Now select {0} again, before we proceed."
Tutorial 03 - Observation 02,"Very good. Now send him to observe the surroundings from the conning tower, by clicking on the small eye icon using the <b>left mouse button</b>."
Tutorial 03 - Helpers 01,"Officer {0} hasn't found anything yet. It's still possible that the freighter is nearby, but beyond our current sight range...

Let's assign him some help."
Tutorial 03 - Helpers 02,"Your crew is composed of officers like the officer {0}, but also regular sailors.

<b>Officers</b> take direct orders from you and you have a direct control over them. You can find the portraits of them in the bottom right part of the screen."
Tutorial 03 - Helpers 03,"<b>Regular sailors</b> on the other hand usually follow automated schedules, as they are too numerous to take orders from the captain, one by one.

They can also aid officers in their work."
Tutorial 03 - Helpers 04,That's exactly what we need right now. Each officer has a few bars near to his portrait. They represent sailors assigned to the officer.
