Message - Germany Declares War on USA.Title,The lifting of all restrictions regarding U.S.A. ships
Message - Germany Declares War on USA,"The lifting of all restrictions regarding U.S.A. ships and the so-called Pan-American safety zone has been ordered by the high command. Therefore, the whole area of the American coasts will become open for operations by U-boats, an area in which the assembly of ships takes place in single traffic at the few points of departure of Atlantic convoys.

There is an opportunity here, therefore, of intercepting enemy merchant ships under conditions which have ceased almost completely for some time. Attempts must be made to utilize as quickly as possible these advantages, which will disappear very shortly, and to achieve a ""spectacular success"" on the American coast.

The following come into question as the main points of attack for such U-boat operations:
 	 	 	
 	Sydney Roads	2,200 miles
 	Halifax	2,400 miles
 	Bermudas	3,000 miles
 	New York	3,000 miles
 	Galveston	4,600 miles
 	Aruba	4,000 miles
 	Trinidad	3,600 miles (approach point for single traffic coming from South and bunkering station)."
Message - Laconia Order.Title,Laconia Order
Message - Laconia Order,"Despite large Red Cross flag U 156 was bombed five times by an American ""Liberator"" type plane while towing 4 full life boats. Both periscopes temporarily out of order. Submarine stopped rescue work and transferred all survivors to the boats.  She was ordered to render no further assistance in any rescue attempts.

Once again all submarines have been told that the safety of our own boats must not be endangered in any circumstances. If necessary, take any steps, even breaking off all rescue work. As shown by the report from U 156, the Commanding Officer did not believe that the enemy would attack when he saw the Red Cross flag and the rescue attempts. This opinion is hard to understand. It must be assumed that he was influenced by seeing hundreds of survivors fighting for their lives.

Orders dealing with bringing captains and chief engineers back remain unchanged."
