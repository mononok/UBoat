Battle of the Atlantic III,The Last Stand
Battle of the Atlantic III Description,"After Black May in 1943, it's now clear that the Allies managed to extend the range of aircraft defences over most of the Atlantic and introduced more advanced weapons. Our U-boat losses increased dramatically and the use of wolfpacks no longer seem to be an effective tactic. But the tide will turn. Our engineers are working on a new wonder weapon, a revolutionary generation of electric u-boats that will let us regain the initiative. U-boats must revert back to lone wolf attacks on the Atlantic to gain us the time needed for that to happen."
