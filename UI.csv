Torpedo flaws Tooltip,"This setting determines how realistic should be the torpedo flaws in the game.

Realistic: Torpedo pistols have flaws that match the historic records. If a torpedo with an impact pistol hits the target at a high angle, it most likely won't detonate.

Semi-realistic: Perfect impact angle is rewarded with an almost guaranteed detonation of a torpedo, although sub-optimal hits usually end up in a detonation too - especially if the torpedo is properly maintainted by a trained officer.

Basic: Torpedo impact angle is ignored and torpedo duds are determined using a flat chance. This chance is very close to zero, if torpedo is properly maintained by a trained officer."

Tutorial Warning,"<align=center><size=40><line-height=50%><b>Warning</b></size>

<align=left><line-height=100%>This scenario is considered obsolete as it doesn't explain many latest game mechanics, while many aspects explained in it are no longer worth learning at the beginning due to more developed automation in the game. It's going to be replaced with a different approach of educating new players about the game in the next months.

While it still works, there are more up to date tutorials made by the community on YouTube, Fandom Wiki and Steam articles section. Our recommendation is to use them instead until a new tutorial is complete.

Hint 1,"<space=55>The ocean is a vast and empty space, hence encountering other ships by a pure luck is very rare. Always use hydrophone to find your prey."
Hint 2,"<space=55>If the discipline on your boat is low, use it as an opportunity to identify sea wolves among your crew and those who are not fit for the service."
Hint 3,"<space=55>If you are ordered to patrol a square on the Atlantic, plot a patrol path with as much longditudinal movement as possible. All convoys cross the Atlantic from west to east or vice versa, so you will increase your chances of crossing the path of a convoy this way."
Hint 4,<space=55>Radiomen on Type VII u-boats are often well trained in first aid.
Hint 5,"<space=55>""The only thing that ever really frightened me during the war was the U-boat peril."" Winston Churchill"
Hint 6,<space=55>You can start tutorial missions by talking with the leading officer in any port.
Hint 7,"<space=55>Once a u-boat's presence is discovered, most captains of surface ships order active torpedo avoidance by following a zig-zagging course. It's much harder to hit such ships with a torpedo attack."
Hint 8,"<space=55>Aircraft are extremely dangerous to u-boats. Don't fight them, unless you have to."
Hint 9,<space=55>Your crew will appreciate some variety in food rations.
Hint 10,"<space=55>Your orders are to sink all ships that trade with the blockaded enemy ports. You can inspect ships that fly a neutral flag to find out where are they headed, if you are suspicious."
Hint 11,<space=55>Some ships may fly a false flag to avoid being torpedoed by u-boats. Carry out an inspection to see if you are dealing with such a situation.
Hint 12,"<space=55>If you lay your submarine on the seabed, enemy sonar will have a much harder time detecting you."
Hint 13,<space=55>Take some coffee with you to keep the officers awake during long engagements.
Hint 14,"<space=55>Type XIV u-boats are often called ""milk cows"". They serve as resupply ships for combat u-boats and will always welcome you with some fresh bread."
Hint 15,"<space=55>When trying to approach the enemy submerged, turn off all unnecessary devices. The enemy can hear them through the hydrophone and discover your location."
UHint 16,<space=55>The character assigned to the listening room operates the radar when the boat is surfaced and the hydrophone when submerged.
Hint 17,"<space=55>If the enemy ship does not want to sink, you can help it with the 88 mm gun mounted on the deck."
Hint 18,<space=55>Explosions of depth charges overwhelm enemy sonars for a short time. It's a window of opportunity for u-boats to escape the area.
Hint 19,<space=55> Searchlights reveal the position of a surface vessel to a greater extent than they increase its view range.
Hint 20,"<space=55>The pump is able to pump water from compartments other than the control room only at a shallow depth, due to resistance in the pipes."
Hint 21,<space=55>Remember to report ships that were sunk on your patrol. This is the only way to be credited for the sinking and receive a reward from high command.
Hint 22,"<space=55>If your boat is submerged at periscope depth during bad weather, consider sending an engineer to the depth steers station. He will prevent broaching and will make observation through periscopes easier by stabilizing the boat."
Hint 23,"<space=55>Enemy ships carry a limited number of depth charges. When they are exhausted, there is a good chance that they will withdraw from submarine hunting."
Hint 24,"<space=55>At greater depths there is a so-called shadow zone. Due to the acoustic layer above it, enemy vessels will find it much harder to detect your ship using hydrophone or sonar."
Hint 25,"<space=55>If the night is dark, consider turning on the red lighting inside your u-boat. Such light makes it easier for the eyes to adapt to the darkness. It will increase the sight range of your crew and will also make your screen brighter."

Story 8,A brawler. When the fight comes he's the first in line. A natural born sailor. Cleans his shoes everyday.
Story 9,"As the son of teachers {0} is very well-read. He is most fascinated by books about seafaring and adventurous naval heroes like Admiral Nelson. He is also musically talented and plays several instruments. Faced with the choice whether he wanted to become a musician or rather go to sea, he decided to join the Kriegsmarine. Unlike many of his comrades, he did not receive his basic nautical training on a regular training ship, but on a sailing training ship. However, he discovered that working at great heights and especially on masts was not necessarily one of his favourites. So after finishing his training he joined the U-boat flotilla for further use and completed his training there with distinction.

He is very much appreciated in his comrades' circle because of his musical talent, is sociable and often provides a little variety on board with musical interludes on the harmonica."
Story 10,{0} grew up in a small village in Austria and has been tinkering with motorbikes since his youth. His uncle persuaded him to join the Kriegsmarine and tried his luck as an engineer with his knowledge of mechanics. During his training he was always very exemplary. He can repair almost anything with a piece of wire. He is very popular with most sailors and likes to play cards.
Story 11,Coming from Schwarzwald. Moved to the Baltic Sea coast with his parents as a child. As a boy he was a long fisherman on his father's boat and soon joined the navy. He has always been drawn to the submarine fleet. He impressed his instructors at the U-School in Kiel with his experience at sea. He is rather introverted and likes to withdraw in case of conflicts. Otherwise a very obedient sailor.
Story 12,"Born in Berlin / Neuk?lln in the vicinity of Airport Berlin Tempelhof {0} has been fascinated by airplanes since his youth. He learned a lot about engines and technology and as soon he graduated from high school he volunteered for the german Luftwaffe for pilot training. However, he was classified as unsuitable because he was too short for the cockpit. Instead, because of his size, he was sent to the Marine U-boot Schule in Kiel. He started his duty reluctantly but adapted to the situation during his training and was finally pleased with to work in submarine technology. Gained a good knowledge of navigation and was trained as a helmsman. Is appreciated by his comrades, does what they told, but rarely shows initiative."
Story 13,"{0}  comes from a Prussian officer family. He also wanted to enter officer candidate school, but he couldn't wait to pay back the British for World War I, in which his uncle died at sea. His father does not respect him because he has not obtained the rank of officer, therefore he does everything in his power to achieve the rank of senior mate as soon as possible and earn medals. According to him, all methods are allowed, which makes him unpopular with his comrades."
Story 14,"Raised as an orphan in a home in Dresden. As a young adult he never really found his place. After serving a prison sentence for petty crimes he decided to join the Kriegsmarine to start a new life. In the barracks he was always in a bad mood with his comrades and officers because of his rugged nature. When he heard about the submarine fleet and the close community, he switched to submarine training. From the very beginning, he had difficulty adjusting to the discipline, but finally managed to establish himself in his new reality. He is known for his dirty talk."
Story 15,"Born in 1923 in Husum on the North Sea. At first he thought about the Luftwaffe. His dream was to become a pilot of the Me-109 fighter. Due to his height, he was rejected as a pilot. The real reason for going into service on submarines was the fear of being drafted into infantry and being sent to the Eastern Front."
Story 16,"As the son of a miner from the Ruhr {0}, he had to work hard at an early age. He left school early and practiced as a bricklayer. With no prospects for the future, he left his home in Dortmund and went to Hamburg to work in the port.

He gets angry easily and often gets into fights. Due to his muscularity and aggressive and dominant behavior, he often intimidates others and uses it from time to time to bully the weaker. He can lead people, but is also not afraid to get his hands dirty. He is used to working long hours. If muscle strength or a loud voice is needed, then he is the right person. He is prone to rough jokes. He doesn't have much education."
Story 17,"He grew up in Hunsr?ck. An experienced electrical engineer. When his wife and daughter lost their lives following the RAF raid on Wilhelmshaven, which he barely survived, he immediately offered the Kriegsmarine his electrical skills and began training in the School's U-boat Fleet."
Story 18,"{0} never thought about serving at sea. His parents have a tavern outside Munich. Even in his youth, he regularly helped in the kitchen. However, the start of the war changed his plan of taking over the tavern. He was called up for military service and served as a kitchen assistant in an infantry battalion. Lentil soup with bacon from the field kitchen was not enough for him, so he volunteered as a ship's cook at the Kriegsmarine.
{0} is always in a good mood and has an inexhaustible repertoire of jokes, which is not always liked by senior officers. Nevertheless, he is highly appreciated by most captains as he maintains high morale even in difficult situations thanks to his cooking skills and cheerful disposition. Additionally, they turn a blind eye to his weight problem. Has good knowledge of food storage."
Story 19,"{0} comes from a  family of sailors living near Bremen. His father is a Kriegsmarine officer and his two brothers serve aboard submarines. It is said that in the barracks he only met the recruiting requirements thanks to his father's connections. Consequently, his training path was not easy. He is very ambitious and works hard to show that he can handle it without any help. Reading is his passion. He is writing his own novel. Due to his strict Catholic upbringing, he is often ridiculed by others."
Story 20,"Born in Osterfeld, he was separated from his father at a young age and grew up in L?beck with his uncle Hans. He left gymnasium and joined the merchant navy. He quickly became a captain and then was unemployed for a long time. Due to lack of prospects, he joined the Kriegsmarine as a midshipman."
Story 21,"Growing up in the mountains on his parents' farm {0} he learned to work hard.
He loved being in nature, being free, and he loved hunting. {0} however, he decided to experience something new and volunteered to serve his country in the ranks of the Kriegsmarine."
Story 22,"{0}  was born as the oldest of four children. His parents divorced around 1928. His single mother moved to Embsen near L?neburg. After eight years at school, {0} began an apprenticeship as a blacksmith. With his bicycle he undertook numerous bicycle tours, which also led him to Hamburg. After visiting the port of Hamburg he decided to become a sailor. The beginning of the war thwarted his plans. He volunteered to serve on a submarine."
Story 23,"Born and raised in Trier, he trained as a dentist in Kiel. His goal was to become a rich man at the age of 30, but after unsuccessful financial speculations he had to close his practice. With no funds, he volunteered for the Kriegsmarine. His colleagues, who underwent basic training with him, emphasize his loyalty to those around him."
Story 24,"Growing up in the small village of Schmiedefeld near Dresden, {0} always dreamed of seeing the big wide world. After his apprenticeship as a locksmith, he was commissioned to work on the coast of Kiel. There, he became interested in working on large ships. When he heard that they were looking for submarine sailors, he volunteered for duty without hesitation."
Story 25,"A descendant of an impoverished noble family. After they bet on the wrong horse during the change of power, all the old splendor was gone. Now, during the war, the family try their best to regain the favor of the authorities, if necessary, also by the heroic deeds of their children."
Story 26,"{0}  had a very happy childhood and grew up in the countryside. After completing his apprenticeship as a baker, he opened a small pastry shop in Friborg on the Elbe. When it was destroyed by fire, he lost everything he had. After that, he decided to join the Kriegsmarine as a sailor and was quickly accepted into the submarine training flotilla. After eight months of basic training, he became a torpedo mechanic. He is popular with his colleagues and likes to make jokes about the officers."
Story 27,"Born in Munich, he helped his parents on the farm at an early age as a pig farmer. He learned butchery and was later trained as a cook. When the war started, he wanted to serve as the ship's cook. As there was an empty seat on the submarine, he volunteered to become ""Smutje"". He copes very well with the lack of space in the galley. While cooking, he likes to tell stories about the mountains near Munich. His culinary skills are deeply appreciated by the crew."
